# headland-286-files
a collection of files for my headland 286 repair

These are the files I captured from the 286 using the Saleae logic analyzer software.

last-400-good4.sal is a good working read of a file with less than 512bytes

last-500-bad.sal is a failed read with more than 512 bytes

pentium.sal was from the same floppy drive and ide controller on a pentium just to test if it all works
